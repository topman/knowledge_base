About me
============

My name is Tower Joo(朱涛 in Chinese), which have the following meaning:

* Tower means a great traditional building, which stands for thousands of years 
* Joo is my family name to match my Chinese name's pronunciation.



I'm living in `Beijing`_, China and I graduated from `GUCAS`_ for my master degree, and
`XIPT`_ for my bachelor degree, in which my major is Computer Sciences.

I love `Python`_, which a great elegent and *stupid* language. I use `Python`_ to work on
*Social Game*, *scripts*, *prototype* and etc. `Django`_, `Sphinx`_ and other `Python`_ related
stuffs are my favorites too.

You can find my blog from `mindsbook`_ and you can also follow me at `@towerjoo twitter`_ (for twitter),
and `@towerjoo sina`_ (for sina).

About the docs
==================

These docs are for my knowledge management. Using `sphinx`_ to record
*What I've learned*, *what should be noticed*, *what tips can be used to ease something*.

I hope the knowledge database will not just benefit myself but also can help others
to avoid some difficulties and traps.

All docs will evolve.
